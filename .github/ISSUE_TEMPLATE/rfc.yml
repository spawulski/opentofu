        Thank you for opening an RFC!
        
        RFCs are a highly-structured format for submitting change requests. All major changes to OpenTofu should first go through an RFC, to have a place for the community to discuss.
        
        The template has a lot of fields and is inspired by the Rust RFC template. Please take your time to fill it out carefully.
        
        Working experimental PoCs in a draft Pull Request are a very welcome attachment to an RFC, especially ones that are easy to check out and take for a spin.
