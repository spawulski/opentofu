# CLI Authentication

TACOS (TF Automation and Collaboration Software) are platforms that perform as part of their
offering OpenTofu runs to provision infrastructure, offering a collaboration-focused
environment that makes it easier for teams to use OpenTofu together.

OpenTofu CLI integrates with TACOS in several ways — it can be a
front-end for CLI-driven runs, and can also use some TACOS as a state backend, a private module
registry, or a private provider registry. All of these integrations require you to authenticate OpenTofu CLI
with your TACOS account.

The best way to handle CLI authentication is with the `login` and `logout`
commands, which help automate the process of getting an API token for your
TACOS user account.
