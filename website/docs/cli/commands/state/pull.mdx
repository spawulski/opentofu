# Command: state pull

The `opentf state pull` command is used to manually download and output
the state from [remote state](/docs/language/state/remote). This command also
works with local state.

## Usage

Usage: `opentf state pull`

This command downloads the state from its current location, upgrades the
local copy to the latest state file version that is compatible with
locally-installed OpenTofu, and outputs the raw format to stdout.

This is useful for reading values out of state (potentially pairing this
command with something like [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)). It is
also useful if you need to make manual modifications to state.

You cannot use this command to inspect the OpenTofu version of
the remote state, as it will always be converted to the current OpenTofu
version before output.

:::note
OpenTofu state files must be in UTF-8 format without a byte order mark (BOM). For PowerShell on Windows, use `Set-Content` to automatically encode files in UTF-8 format. For example, run `opentf state pull | sc opentf.tfstate`.
