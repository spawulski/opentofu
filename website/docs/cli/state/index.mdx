# Manipulating OpenTofu State

OpenTofu uses [state data](/docs/language/state) to remember which
real-world object corresponds to each resource in the configuration;
this allows it to modify an existing object when its resource declaration
changes.

OpenTofu updates state automatically during plans and applies. However, it's
sometimes necessary to make deliberate adjustments to OpenTofu's state data,
usually to compensate for changes to the configuration or the real managed
infrastructure.

OpenTofu CLI supports several workflows for interacting with state:

- [Inspecting State](/docs/cli/state/inspect)
- [Forcing Re-creation](/docs/cli/state/taint)
- [Moving Resources](/docs/cli/state/move)
- Importing Pre-existing Resources (documented in the
  [Importing Infrastructure](/docs/cli/import) section)
- [Disaster Recovery](/docs/cli/state/recover)

:::warning Important
Modifying state data outside a normal plan or apply can cause
OpenTofu to lose track of managed resources, which might waste money, annoy
your colleagues, or even compromise the security of your operations. Make sure
to keep backups of your state data when modifying state out-of-band.
