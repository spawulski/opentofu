# OpenTofu CLI Documentation

This is the documentation for OpenTofu CLI. It is relevant to anyone working
with OpenTofu's CLI-based workflows; this includes people who use OpenTofu CLI
by itself, as well as those who use OpenTofu CLI in conjunction with
TACOS (TF Automation and Collaboration Software).

Notably, this documentation does not cover the syntax and usage of the OpenTofu
language. For that, see the
[OpenTofu Language Documentation](/docs/language).
