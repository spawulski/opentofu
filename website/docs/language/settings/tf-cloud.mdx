  The nested `cloud` block configures OpenTofu's integration with a cloud backend.

# Cloud Configuration

The main module of an OpenTofu configuration can integrate with a cloud backend to enable its [CLI-driven run workflow](/docs/cloud-docs/run/cli). You only need to configure these settings when you want to use OpenTofu CLI to interact with a cloud backend.
A cloud backend ignores them when interacting with OpenTofu through version control or the API.

## Usage Example

To configure the cloud CLI integration, add a nested `cloud` block within the `terraform` block. You cannot use the CLI integration and a [state backend](/docs/language/settings/backends/configuration) in the same configuration.

Refer to [Using the Cloud Backend](/docs/cli/cloud) in the OpenTofu CLI documentation for full configuration details, migration instructions, and command line arguments.

```hcl
terraform {
  cloud {
    organization = "example_corp"
    hostname = "app.example.io"

    workspaces {
      tags = ["app"]
    }
  }
}
```
